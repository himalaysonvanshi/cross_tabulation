The calcuation of cross tabulation is on webpage only. 
That works for small to medium size of csv file. 

For large csv files only,
	- We can fetch only some rows of csv data to show to user with the option "See more".
	- We move the cross tabulation calcuation part on server side and send ajax request to server to get the result.

	pros :-
		- We are never loading the full file ever in memory. So memory problems can be avoided on server side.
		- We are never giving full data to webpage. So that we can prevent webpage crashing.
	
	cons :- 
		- We are requesting everything on server. So we have to wait for server to respond for every query.
