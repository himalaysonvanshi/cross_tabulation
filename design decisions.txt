I have used bootstrap for creating responsive page.

I have passed the csv data to the webpage. 
So that for a fair amount of size of csv file it would work as fast it can get.
The logic of cross tabulation is also written in the javascript.

(see enhancements.txt for large csv file handling)

Pros :-
	- The benefit of having loaded the data on the webpage is removing lag becouse of network overhead.
	- It now would not need to send ajax requests to server to get cross tabulation calculation or showing the csv data into table. 
	
Cons :- 
	- This would not work if the csv file size is too large.
